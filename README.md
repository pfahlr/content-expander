# Content Expansion

This is a simple LLM driven application. It should be useful for it's intended purpose ("to reformat blog posts into a number of variations: youtube script, twitter post, post in another voice, etc.") and also be a good starting point for similar applications as the entire architecture (containers, database, reverse proxies, front end, backend) has already been created. 

This is an excellent starting point, really for any application that runs on a react frontend with a REST api backend with a postgresql data source...
